/** 
 * 6.10 (Pixel Quantization) Use a one-dimensional array to solve the following problem: You
 * want to eventually perform some basic compression on an image. Assume that you will only be operating on a single row of the image, and that pixel colors are represented as simple numbers in the
 * array. You are required to quantize the values of the pixels in the row. In other words, any pixel values appearing in a range will assume a value in that range as indicated below. This creates redundancy that can lead to better compression. Overwrite the original values in the array.
 * a) For 0–20: 10
 * b) For 21–40: 30
 * c) For 41–60: 50
 * d) For 61–80: 70
 * e) For 81–100: 90
 * f) For 101–120: 110
 * g) For 121–140: 130
 * h) For 141–160: 150
 * i) For 161–180: 170, and for all other pixel values, assumed a quantized value of 190
 * Print the array with the new, quantized values
